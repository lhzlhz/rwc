# Resources With Code

This work is a collection of resources with code, inspired by [pwc](https://github.com/zziz/pwc), which is a splendid repository to collect  **papers with code** according to different years. 

In contrast, this project mainly focuses on resources about **environment perception**  technology in  **autonomous vehicle** field, especially about the **lidar**, **vision**, or **sensors fusion** related algorithm.

These resources are sorted by different **perception** tasks and will be updated regularly. This repository conforms the principle **"not much, but good"**, involves the **excellent** resources including **papers, websits, reseachers and so on.**
